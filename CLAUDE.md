- ALWAYS reference ./Planning/PRD.md when planning new tasks.
- ALWAYS reference ./Planning/screenshots/*.png when creating Views and working on UI.
- ALWAYS reference ./vinylogue-legacy/TCSVinylogueDesign.h when implementing colors and fonts.
- ALWAYS consider visual appearance should match the legacy application; dark mode is NOT supported. 
- ALWAYS reference the legacy code in ./vinylogue-legacy when determining UX and styling for a feature.
- ALWAYS run xcodegen after adding/removing/renaming files.
- ALWAYS run swiftformat on all changed files before building ignoring the output. If the command fails, run it again and read the error.
- ALWAYS build with xcodebuild when a feature is complete ignoring the output. If the command returns errors, run it again observing the errors returned.
- ALWAYS run tests when a feature is complete ignoring the output and ensure there are no failures.
- ALWAYS update PRD.md to reflect the current status of the sprint.
- NEVER look in ./DerivedData unless absolutely necessary to determine the cause of a build error. If so, be very very careful about how many tokens you look at.
- NEVER write UI tests until you have confirmed with me that the UI is 100% correct.
- ALWAYS use the iPhone 16 Pro simulator on iOS 18.5 with UUID AE8D703E-E213-443C-8CBC-742F8807CCC3 (if it is unavailable, then alert me).
