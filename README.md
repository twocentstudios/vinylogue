## Learn

This project was both an app I wanted to exist, and a learning experience for me regarding [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa). I hope other iOS devs can learn from it. I haven't done much open source in the past, and have learned by studying the source great projects such as [Cheddar](https://github.com/nothingmagical/cheddar-ios) and [news:yc](https://github.com/Xuzz/newsyc) (amongst many others), so it felt like it was time to give back.

I wrote a pretty extensive [blog post](http://twocentstudios.com/blog/2013/04/03/the-making-of-vinylogue/) covering several parts of the design and development of this app. If you're looking for a guided tour through the source, check that out first.

License for source is Modified BSD. If there's enough interest, I can modularize particular parts of the source into their own MIT Licensed components.

This is very much an experiment for me that I'm hoping doesn't backfire. If you'd like to improve the app, please fork and submit pull requests and we'll keep one version on the App Store for everyone to enjoy. Don't charge for other versions (I'm pretty sure it violates Last.fm's TOS anyway).
